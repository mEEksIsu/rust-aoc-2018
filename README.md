## Advent of Code 2018, Rusting in 2019 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zoewithabang/rust-aoc-2018.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zoewithabang/rust-aoc-2018)

I'm using the Advent of Code 2018 challenges to learn a bit about how to solve problems with Rust.

Much of the code likely is not very idiomatic (or performant) yet but I hope to keep improving as I go! :]
